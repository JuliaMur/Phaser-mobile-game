# Phaser mobile game
 A simple mobile game using Phaser framework.
 
For the main actions of the player used already prepared framework patterns.

For my part, I added and changed the following:

- Completely changed the game graphics (new characters, background).
- Added sound (music in the background, sound effects of the player's actions).
- Buttons to turn off / on sound.
- Score counter.
- Game level counter.
- Increasing the difficulty of the game with each level.
- Reload the game after game over.

This was my first experience developing a game in JavaScript.
